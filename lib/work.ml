    Command. Prints information from the reference manual about the primitive

    which help is available. If there is an environment variable LOGOHELP, then
    its value is taken as the directory in which to look for help files, instead
    of the default help directory.

    If HELP is called with the name of a defined procedure for which there is no
    help file, it will print the title line of the procedure followed by lines
    from the procedure body that start with semicolon, stopping when a
    non-semicolon line is seen.
