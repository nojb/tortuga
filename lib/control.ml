CATCH tag instructionlist

    Command or operation. Runs its second input. Outputs if that instructionlist
    outputs. If, while running the instructionlist, a THROW instruction is
    executed with a tag equal to the first input (case-insensitive comparison),
    then the running of the instructionlist is terminated immediately. In this
    case the CATCH outputs if a value input is given to THROW. The tag must be a
    word.

    If the tag is the word ERROR, then any error condition that arises during
    the running of the instructionlist has the effect of THROW \"ERROR instead
    of printing an error message and returning to toplevel. The CATCH does not
    output if an error is caught. Also, during the running of the
    instructionlist, the variable ERRACT is temporarily unbound. (If there is an
    error while ERRACT has a value, that value is taken as an instructionlist to
    be run after printing the error message. Typically the value of ERRACT, if

THROW tag
(THROW tag value)

    Command. Must be used within the scope of a CATCH with an equal tag. Ends
    the running of the instructionlist of the CATCH. If THROW is used with only
    one input, the corresponding CATCH does not output a value. If THROW is used
    with two inputs, the second provides an output for the CATCH.

    THROW \"TOPLEVEL can be used to terminate all running procedures and
    interactive pauses, and return to the toplevel instruction prompt. Typing
    the system interrupt character (<alt-S> for wxWidgets; otherwise normally
    <control-C> for Unix, <control-Q> for DOS, or <command-period> for Mac) has
    the same effect.

    THROW \"ERROR can be used to generate an error condition. If the error is
    not caught, it prints a message (THROW \"ERROR) with the usual indication of
    where the error (in this case the THROW) occurred. If a second input is used
    along with a tag of ERROR, that second input is used as the text of the
    error message instead of the standard message. Also, in this case, the
    location indicated for the error will be, not the location of the THROW, but
    the location where the procedure containing the THROW was invoked. This
    allows user-defined procedures to generate error messages as if they were
    primitives. Note: in this case the corresponding CATCH \"ERROR, if any, does
    not output, since the second input to THROW is not considered a return
    value.

    THROW \"SYSTEM immediately leaves Logo, returning to the operating system,
    without printing the usual parting message and without deleting any editor
    temporary file written by EDIT."

PAUSE

    Command or operation. Enters an interactive pause. The user is prompted for
    instructions, as at toplevel, but with a prompt that includes the name of
    the procedure in which PAUSE was invoked. Local variables of that procedure
    are available during the pause. PAUSE outputs if the pause is ended by a
    CONTINUE with an input.

    If the variable ERRACT exists, and an error condition occurs, the contents
    of that variable are run as an instructionlist. Typically ERRACT is given
    the value [PAUSE] so that an interactive pause will be entered in the event
    of an error. This allows the user to check values of local variables at the
    time of the error.

    Typing the system quit character (<alt-S> for wxWidgets; otherwise normally
